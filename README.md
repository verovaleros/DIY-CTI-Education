What?
=====
This is my attempt to document my DYI education on CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence).

Why? 
====
Is simple. I had basic information security education at University, but not profound. I'm interested in learning more about CTI, but there aren't any guides. While I'm looking for material, reading through it, summarizing it, why not documenting it here so other people may benefit from it.
